#Puzzle Slider Game

A simple 3x3 image puzzle game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Drag the tiles to restore the original image.

## Features

- Drag-and-drop tile movement
- Turn counter to track moves
- "Show Answer" button to toggle the original image
- Displays a congratulatory message when the puzzle is solved
- Custom image and styling

## Based On

This project is based on a JavaScript tutorial I followed to learn how drag-and-drop works. I customized it by:

- Using a custom image
- Creating a "Show/Hide Answer" toggle button
- Changing the background and layout
- Adding a win detection message

## How to Play

1. Rearrange the tiles by dragging them.
2. Try to match the original image.
3. Press "Show Answer" if you need a hint.

## What I Learned

- DOM manipulation
- Event handling in JavaScript
- Drag-and-drop API
- Basic game logic
